# OxyPlotNoesisGUI
This repo contains a version of the OxyPlot charting library modified to use NoesisGUI (http://www.noesisengine.com/noesis_gui_features.htm) for rendering inside Unity3D. 
You need to provide your own implementation of some classes in the .Net framework that are not included in Unity3D. 
You can use the .Net reference source (http://referencesource.microsoft.com) as reference (doh), but its license prohibits use 
other than that.

This is still very much a work in progress. There is a LOT of code that is commented out to get the project to compile,
and a lot of things will probably not work at all or start falling apart if when changing even simple things.

Any contributions are welcome!
